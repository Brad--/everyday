# Project Title

Everyday is a progressive web application focused on a simple user experience. Its purpose is to help users keep track of things they want to do every day. No reminders, no nudging. This is designed to aid my personal workflow, and it is not intended to influence its own usage.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


:construction: The following link works, but the section a placeholder for now. :construction:
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```

### Work Environment

This is more of a suggestion and some organization of things I like,

#### Languages and Technologies
###### A useful list of resources
[Python 3.7.1](https://www.python.org/)

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/)

#### Editor (optional)
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): This is the editor I use. I recommend its [Python package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

#### Linter
[Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) :construction: This will hopefully have CI soon tm  :construction:

### Installing

Make sure your prerequisites are installed and run the following command to install the python dependencies:

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
